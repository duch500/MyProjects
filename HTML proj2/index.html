            <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>

            <ul class="list">
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">2004</span> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
